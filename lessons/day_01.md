# Day 1

In this first day we are given a two lists of numbers and we need to calculate the distance for the part 1 and the similarily for the part 2.

Aside the help of the chatbot how to get the input from the website, I was working to solve the puzzles by myself.

Things I learned today:

* String processing like `line.split_whitespace()` and parse the separated values to integers. Using `Some` enum to check if the value is not `None`.
* Vector Operations like `zip` to iterate over two vectors at the same time or `push` to add a new element to a vector, sort a vector with `sort`.
* Using `HashMap` to store the values and check if a value is already in the map.
* Using `Result` to handle errors and `unwrap` to get the value from the `Result` if it is `Ok`.
