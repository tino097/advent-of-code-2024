# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges!
My goal is to solve all the puzzles in Rust and to learn more about the language and its ecosystem.

In this repostory I will also track the lessons learned and the improvements I made to the code.

## Day 1

The [first](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) puzzle is usually easiest and it wont need to much time to get [solved](lessons/day_01.md).
